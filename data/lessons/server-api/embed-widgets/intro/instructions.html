<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to integate Linkurious with an embeddable widget (iframe).</p>

<p>In this scenario the user fills in a form that generates a graph query. We skip this step for the tutorial  so we will directly log in on the server, and query the graph with a Cypher query. We will then create a new visualization object on the server. We will finally create a web widget of the visualization to embed it on a web page.</p>

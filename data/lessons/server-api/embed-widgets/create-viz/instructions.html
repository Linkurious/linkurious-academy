    We have seen how to run a graph query.
    In this exercise we will learn to create a new visualization from the result of the graph query.
    We will assign node coordinates in the 2d space.
    We will then retrieve the data source configuration to set colors and size according to the properties of the nodes.
    We finally create the visualization with the defined content.
    Notice that this visualization is available on the user dashboard of Linkurious Enterprise.

    Edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the API endpoint
    that provides the visualization creation service.

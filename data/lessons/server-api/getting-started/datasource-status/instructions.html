    It is time to discover the data-sources available through the instance of Linkurious.
    A data-source gives access to a single database at a given time.
    However, the data-source may not always serve the same database.
    For instance, administrators can switch databases provided by a Neo4j server.
    Linkurious identifies each combination (data-source, database) with a unique <strong>key</strong>.
    This key is made of the data-source information and the database unique identifier.
    You always need the key to query a data-source.

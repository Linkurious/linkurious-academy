<p>It is time to discover the datasources available throught the instance of Linkurious. A datasource gives access to a single database at a given time. However, the datasource may not always serve the same database. For instance, administrators can switch databases provided by a Neo4j server. Linkurious identifies each combination (datasource, database) with a unique <strong>key</strong>. This key is made of the datasource information and the database unique identifier. You always need the key to query a datasource.</p>

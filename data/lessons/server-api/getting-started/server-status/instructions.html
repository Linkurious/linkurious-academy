    During these tutorials we will send AJAX requests with a helper library called
    <a href="https://github.com/pyrsmk/qwest#quick-examples" target="_blank">qwest</a>.
    We have pre-loaded each exercise with sample code so you don't need to learn it specifically,
    and you can focus on the API of Linkurious server.
</p>

<p>
    Let's first check if the Linkurious server is online.
    To do so, edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the API
    endpoint that provides the server status.

    You can access
    <a href="https://linkurious.github.io/server-apidoc/#api-Linkurious-Status" target="_blank">Linkurious' API documentation</a>,
    or reveal the solution by clicking on the <strong>"Cheat"</strong> button.
    Once your code is valid, click on the <strong>"Next exercise"</strong> button to the next step.

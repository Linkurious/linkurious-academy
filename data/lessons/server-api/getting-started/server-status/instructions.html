<p>During these tutorials we will send AJAX requests with a helper library called <a href="https://github.com/pyrsmk/qwest#quick-examples" target="_blank">qwest</a>. We have pre-loaded each exercice with sample code so you don't need to learn it specifically, and you can focus on the API of Linkurious server.</p>

<p>Let first check if the Linkurious server is online. To do so, edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the API endpoint that provides the server status. You can access the documentation <a href="http://linkurio.us/docs/api/#api-Linkurious-Status" target="_blank">here</a>, or reveal the solution by clicking on the <strong>"Cheat"</strong> button. Once your code is valid, click on the <strong>"Next exercise"</strong> button to the next step.</p>

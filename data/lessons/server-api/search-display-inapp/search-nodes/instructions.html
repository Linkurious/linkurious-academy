<p>
    In this exercise we will see how to search nodes through the REST API.
    We want to get all nodes for which at least one property matches the specified query string.
    To do so, edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the
    API endpoint that provides the search service.

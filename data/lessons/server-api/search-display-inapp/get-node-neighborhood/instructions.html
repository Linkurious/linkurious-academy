<p>
    We are almost ready to explore the graph!
    In the previous example we have seen how to search nodes and how to get data of a node selected
    from the search results.
    We want to display this node with its neighborhood, i.e. its adjacent nodes and the edges between them.
</p>

<p>
    We will use a different service than in the previous example to get the node's neighborhood.
    Edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the API endpoint
    that provides the node neighborhood service.
    Notice how we format the result to prepare for visualization in the following exercise.

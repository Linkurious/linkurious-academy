<p>Finally we can wrap this chapter into a nice interactive demo. Users can search nodes and get instant results in a list. Clicking on a search result will display the related node and its neighborhood on screen.</p>

<p>The visualization is created with the <a href="https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js" target="_blank">linkurious.js</a> library. Double-clicking on these nodes will expand their connections. Notice that the layout is computed automatically.</p>

<p> You can access the demo <a href="/data/lessons/server-api/search-display-inapp/interactive-viz/default-code.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>

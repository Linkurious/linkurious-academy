<p>We have seen that a search query may return multiple hits. These hits are grouped by node category and sorted by relevance within each group, from most to least relevant hit. In this exercise we will simulate the user picking the first hit of the list, and we will query the Linkurious server to get the node properties and categories.</p>

<p>To do so, edit the following source code by replacing <code>&lt;EDIT_HERE&gt;</code> with the API endpoint that provides the graph service.</p>
